Objective:
-The Iris Flower Classification project aims to classify iris flowers into three distinct species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using their physical features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Overview:
-This project leverages the well-known Iris dataset, which contains measurements from 150 iris flowers. Each flower is categorized based on its dimensions, providing a practical introduction to machine learning classification techniques.

Workflow:
1. Data Acquisition: Utilize the Iris dataset, available in libraries like Scikit-learn or from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of each class and visualize relationships using scatter plots and pair plots.
3. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by normalizing values if necessary and splitting it into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
4. Model Selection and Training: Implement various classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to train the model on the training dataset.
5. Model Evaluation: Assess the accuracy and performance of the model using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
